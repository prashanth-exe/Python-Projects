# Python Projects
This repository contains all small range projects made out of pure python.
Below given are a list of my personal projects.

# How to use ?
Run the .py file in your local code editor or a python shell to use it.

# 1. Speech Assistant
A Speech Assistant based on pure Python which can execute basic Native web-based commands.

# 2. Music.py
A python-library called 'winsound' is used to achieve binary sounds or 'beeps' using 16-bits of data. A guide is provided in the .py file as to how it works with the music notations of the binary sounds.

# 3. Decrypt the Word
A simple .py script which tries to guess the user-given word by running all iterations in each character. Includes Alphabets and Numbers only.

# 4. Colors
A game based on tkinter library with a basic GUI to guess the displayed color on text.

# 5. Keylogger
